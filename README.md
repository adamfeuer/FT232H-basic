FT232H-basic
============

FTDI FT232H to USART basic breakout board - can do USB 2.0 High Speed, up to 10Mbps USART

This board is untested - I haven't made or tested it yet. When I do so I'll update this file.

To Do: 

 * The 1x6 surface mount female header is hard to find - in the next revision I'll change that to a through-hole version.
 * The ESD protection IC is not suitable for USB 2.0 speeds, so will have to be replaced with one that is.

I will make these changes in the next revision.

If you make one and have improvements or comments, I would love to know them - contact me
using the info below!

cheers
adam
