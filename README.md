FT232H-basic
============

This is an FTDI FT232H to USART basic breakout board - it can do USB 2.0 High Speed, and up to 10Mbps 
on the USART interface.

It has USB 2.0 High Speed ESD protection and a resettable fuse on the power input.

NOTE: This board is untested - I haven't made or tested it yet. When I do so I'll update this file.

If you have questions, comments, or improvements, I would love to know them!
