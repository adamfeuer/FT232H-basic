FT232H-basic
============

This is an FTDI FT232H to USART basic breakout board - it can do USB 2.0 High Speed, and up to 10Mbps 
on the USART interface.

It has USB 2.0 High Speed ESD protection and a resettable fuse on the power input.

This board has been made, tested, and works for send and receive at USB 2.0 HS speeds. 

Known issues
============

TX and RX LEDs did not work on the 0.4.2 version of the board - because the signals are active low,
and needed to be connected to 3.3V via a 470 ohm resistor. This has been fixed.

If you have questions, comments, or improvements, I would love to know them!
