FT232H-basic
============

This is an FTDI FT232H to USART basic breakout board - it can do USB 2.0 High Speed, and up to 10Mbps 
on the USART interface.

It has USB 2.0 High Speed ESD protection and a resettable fuse on the power input.

This board has been made, tested, and works for send and receive at USB 2.0 HS speeds. 

Known issues
============

On the board I made, the TX and RX LEDS don't work. I am not sure why - it may be because I installed them wrong.

If you have questions, comments, or improvements, I would love to know them!
